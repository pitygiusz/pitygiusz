# Hi there 👋

I’m **Piotr Jurczyk** — Data Science student at Warsaw University of Technology, with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and a solid foundation in programming and data analysis. Feel free to explore my current projects!

## 🧑‍💻 Personal Projects

- **[NYC-ML-Project](https://github.com/pitygiusz/NYC-ML-Project)** (ongoing) - analysis of parking violation patterns and citibike usage with predictive modeling using scikit-learn.
 
- **[Flowers-Recognition](https://github.com/pitygiusz/Flowers-Recognition)** - building Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch for image recognition.
 
- **[Titanic-ML-Project](https://github.com/pitygiusz/Titanic-ML-Project)** - Using various ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost + ensemble). Kaggle competition submission (ACC = 0.78229).
  

## 🎓 University Coursework Projects

- **Review rating prediction** (ongoing) - experimenting with different text representations and Building a model to predict one fo 5 classes for each review using regression or classification.

- **AirPollutionPredictor** (ongoing) - collecting and logging air quality and weather data from API. Building a model to forecast smog levels using historical data.
 
- **Brain-To-Text** (ongoing) - building a brain-computer interface (BCI) for decoding speech from brain activity. Current model uses CNN and BiLSTM.

- **[Airplanes-R-Project](https://github.com/pitygiusz/Airplanes-R-Project)** - Short- vs long-term trends in airplane traffic after WTC Attacks.
